This research aims to enhance chest Xray diagnosis employing convolutional neural networks (CNNs). To this end, three datasets have
been chosen to carry out our experiments. The final
dataset is a combination of the first two datasets,
comprising five distinct classes: Tuberculosis, COVID-19, Lung Opacity (Non-Covid Lung Infection), Viral
Pneumonia, and Normal. Four CNN models, namely,
Xception, InceptionResnetV2, EfficientnetV2B1, and
Densenet169, has been evaluated on the three
datasets. Leveraging the power of transfer learning
and data augmentation, the models exhibited exceptional performance, achieving accuracy scores surpassing 90% across all classes. This work contributes
valuable insights into the robustness of CNNs in multi-class classification tasks, emphasizing their efficacy
in the accurate and reliable prediction of various
respiratory diseases. The findings hold significant
implications for advancing diagnostic capabilities in
the field of medical imaging and contribute to the
ongoing discourse on leveraging deep learning for
enhanced healthcare outcomes.
